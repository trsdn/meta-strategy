# Sprint Velocity

Track sprint-over-sprint performance to calibrate future sprint sizing.

| Sprint | Date | Goal | Planned | Done | Carry | ~Hours | Issues/Hr | Notes |
|--------|------|------|---------|------|-------|--------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | 2026-02-13 | Foundation: schema, engine, indicators, definitions | 6 | 6 | 0 | ~0.5 | 12.0 | First sprint — setup + foundation |
| 2 | 2026-02-13 | CLI, validator, README, strategy generation | 4 | 4 | 0 | ~0.3 | 13.3 | All backlog cleared |
