# Bollinger Bands — Trend-Following Breakout Strategy
# Expected result: ~1,187% Net Profit (from input.md)

name: "Bollinger Bands"
indicator_source: "strategies/indicators/bollinger-bands.pine"

entry_condition: "the Close Price is ABOVE the Upper Bollinger Band (buying strength — breakout above)"
exit_condition: "the Close Price is BELOW the Lower Bollinger Band"

special_instructions:
  - "IMPORTANT: Buy when close is above upper band, Sell when close is below lower band. The AI often guesses the opposite (mean reversion). This is a TREND FOLLOWING breakout strategy, not mean reversion."
  - "The strategy enters/exits on the next candle open after the condition is met (standard Pine Script behavior)."
